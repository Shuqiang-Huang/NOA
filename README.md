Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is a severe form of male infertility characterized by significantly reduced or exhausted spermatogenic function in the testis. The current guidelines recommend improving spermatogenesis as the optimal surgical sperm retrieval option for treating NOA. A large number of genes associated with programmed cell death (PCD) have been connected to impaired spermatogenesis, suggesting that these genes may serve as biomarkers. By utilizing expression information from 206 patients in 7 multicenter cohorts, 38 consensus genes were identified. After transforming 15 machine learning techniques into 675 models, average AUC and five-fold cross-validation were employed to ascertain which method was the most effective in detecting biomarkers. The findings from the training cohort and external validation cohort consistently demonstrated the accurate prognostic prediction of NOA using the selected biomarkers. Importantly, our PCDscore system, constructed using these biomarkers, holds significant clinical implications for NOA. Denser immune cell infiltrates and aberrant cell contacts were seen in patients with higher PCD scores. Notably, KU-0063794, a strong mTOR inhibitor, demonstrated potential as a treatment drug for NOA patients with different PCD scores. Overall, our research offers a useful tool that could direct the clinical management and individualized treatment of NOA.
